# Atrophy (FPS game)

Atrophy is a fast paced FPS game with a bunch of different enemies and weapons.

## How to play

The game should currently be minimized. Press ctrl + tab to switch to the tab called **RetroFPS_Coursework (DEBUG)**, then click the tutorial button on the main menu first, this will run you through a short course that explains the controls. Make sure you're using the mouse and _not_ the trackpad to aim.

## Difficulty

The game can get quite difficult, especially when there is more than one enemy at once. Make sure you are constantly jumping and moving, and switching weapons to the ones with ammo.

## Reset

To reset the game, please click the **Completely Wipe Save** button in the gameplay options. Then, ctrl + tab to the form, and then back to this file so the next person can read it.
